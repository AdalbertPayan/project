Introduction

The Car Accident Death Rates Analysis project aims to explore and analyze death rates caused by car accidents across different states in the year 2021, taking into account the total population of each state. By conducting this analysis, our objective is to identify patterns, correlations, and trends that can provide evidence-based insights for decision-makers and stakeholders in the fields of public health and policy.

Car accidents remain a significant public health concern, and understanding the factors contributing to varying death rates across states is crucial for formulating effective strategies to improve road safety and reduce fatalities. Through this project, we seek to shed light on the disparities in car accident-related deaths and empower policymakers to make informed decisions to address this issue.

Features

Data cleaning and preprocessing: The project provides scripts and notebooks to clean and preprocess the car accident data for analysis.

Exploratory data analysis: The data is analyzed using descriptive statistics, charts, and graphs to identify trends and patterns.

-Geospatial visualization: Accident locations are visualized on maps to understand their geographical distribution.

1. Is population size directly related to accident deaths per year per state?
We were initially under the assumption that this would be correct, but...

In our findings, our bar graph and scatter plot did show a correlation between population size and death rates in 2021.


2. We were excited about these findings, but then we asked the question:
What is the percentage of accident deaths in 2021 related to population size?

We created an excel file with a map showing the population vs accident death rates and percentage of death rates/population. 
The map shows that the percentage of death rates per population

3. Is the location of each state (west coast or east coast, or mid west) related to accident deaths?
NO, the map clearly shows the top 3 states with most accident death rates, CA, TX, and FL, all in different areas of the USA.
