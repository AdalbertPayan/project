Objective, is population size directly related to accident deaths in each state in 2021?

1. Is population size directly related to accident deaths per year per state?

We were initially under the assumption that this would be correct, but...

In our findings, our bar graph and scatter plot did show a correlation between population
size and death rates in 2021.


2. We were excited about these findings, but then we asked the question:
What is the percentage of accident deaths in 2021 related to population size?

We created an excel file with a map showing the population vs accident death rates and percentage of death rates/population. 
The map shows that the percentage of death rates per population

3. Is the location of each state (west coast or east coast, or mid west) related to accident deaths?
NO, the map clearly shows the top 3 states with most accident death rates, CA, TX, and FL, all in different areas of the USA.
